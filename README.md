# Data Mining Project : Regression and Classification Models
This project was completed as part of the “Data Mining” course during my Bachelor’s studies at the Lebanese American University. It involves the application of linear regression and logistic regression models across three phases, using R. 

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Linear Regression
- Goal: Apply linear regression to model relationships between variables
- Dataset: Student Performance Prediction Dataset
- Techniques:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Data visualization
  - Simple Linear Regression 
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Interaction terms analysis
  - Performance evaluation (RSE, R²)

### Phase 2: Logistic Regression
- Objective: Binary classification of disease outcomes using logistic regression
- Dataset: Diseases dataset with demographic and clinical variables
- Techniques:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Data visualization
  - Feature selection using:
    - Best subset selection
    - Forward selection
    - Backward selection
  - Model comparison (Cp, BIC..)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Resampling techniques: Validation Set Approach
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  - Regularized Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
  - Evaluation metrics:
    - Accuracy
    - Confusion matrix
    - ROC curves and AUC

### Phase 3: Tree-Based Models and Unsupervised Learning
- Objective: Apply more advanced machine learning techniques for classification and
  exploratory data analysis
- Dataset: Balanced disease dataset with demographic and clinical predictors
- Techniques:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Data visualization
  - Tree-based models:
    - Decision Trees
    - Pruning
  - Ensemble learning methods:
    - Bagging
    - Random Forest
    - Boosting
  - Model evaluation and comparison
  - Unsupervised learning techniques:
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - K-means clustering
    - Hierarchical clustering (complete, average, single linkage)
  - Evaluation metrics:
    - Accuracy
    - Confusion matrix
    - ROC curves and AUC
    - Out-of-bag error
